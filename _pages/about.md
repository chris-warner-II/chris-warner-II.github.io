Rigorous discussion of my academic work can be found in my [Publications](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/publications/). My work history and skills are highlighted in [CV](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/cv/). A short professional and personal history is provided in the [About](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/bio/) section.
