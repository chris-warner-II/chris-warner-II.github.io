Rigorous discussion of my academic work can be found in the [Publications](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/publications/) section. My work history and skills are highlighted in [CV](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/cv/). Check out some of my more purely creative works in [Art](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/art/). A short professional and personal history is provided in the [About](https://chris-warner-ii.github.io/bio/) section, along with contact info if you would like to reach out!
