Professional
======

I am currently a postdoctoral affiliate researcher at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov), where I am investigating the temporal complexity of human speech with [Kris Bouchard](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/kristofer-e-bouchard/). Before that, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at [CODA Biotherapeutics](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coda-biotherapeutics) applying machine learning and NLP models to predict protein-ligand interactions for drug discovery and gene therapy. I earned my Ph.D. in Biophysics with Dr. Friedrich Sommer at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu), University of California, Berkeley. I also pursued a masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the [University of Arizona](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu). Between undergrad and graduate school, I worked at [MIT Linconl Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu). I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the [Ohio State University](https://physics.osu.edu). I graduated from Middletown High School North in 2000.


Personal
======

Say something here about me personally.


Since my Ph.D., I have taken some time to pursue personal growth and a passion for music. During that time, I self-produced an album of original songs I wrote, performed and recorded. 

My interest in lyrics and poetry led me to a side project exploring phonemic word representations and transformer networks.
