Professional
======

I am currently a postdoctoral affiliate researcher at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov), where I am investigating the temporal complexity of human speech with Dr. Kris Bouchard. Before that, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at [CODA Biotherapeutics](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coda-biotherapeutics) applying machine learning and NLP models to drug discovery and gene therapy. I earned my Ph.D. in Biophysics studying visual processing with Dr. Friedrich Sommer at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu), University of California, Berkeley. Prior to that, I also pursued a masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering and performed research in robotics at the [University of Arizona](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu). Between undergrad and graduate school, I worked for 4 years as an Electrical Engineer focusing on Radar systems at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu). I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the [Ohio State University](https://physics.osu.edu), graduating magna cum laude and conducting geodetics research with the [Bevis Lab](https://earthsciences.osu.edu/people/bevis.6). I graduated from Middletown High School North in 2000 near the top of my class.

Personal
======

More of a mesh than a spear, I have a breadth of experience - casting a wide net of interests and support - combined with the skill and fortitude to attempt challenging things and excel in unfamiliar territory. Following my inate sense of adventure has led me to work in many interesting fields including geophysics, radar, robotics, neuroscience and machine learning. It has also led me to travel extensively across India and America, even spending a season working as a commercial fisherman in Alaska. In my freetime, I have pursued self-expression through art by writing poetry, performing and recording music and creating works of visual art. I aspire to live creatively, courageously and honestly. I value collaboration and community and I would like to find right livelihood working with a team where I can contribute to and grow into something larger. Thank you for reading.
