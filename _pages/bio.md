Before that, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at [CODA Biotherapeutics](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coda-biotherapeutics) applying machine learning and NLP models to drug discovery and gene therapy. I earned my Ph.D. in Biophysics studying visual processing with Dr. Friedrich Sommer at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu), University of California, Berkeley. Prior to that, I also pursued a masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the [University of Arizona](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu). Between undergrad and graduate school, I worked for 4 years as an Electrical Engineer focusing on Radar systems at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu). I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the [Ohio State University](https://physics.osu.edu), graduating magna cum laude and conducting geodetics research with the [Bevis Lab](https://earthsciences.osu.edu/people/bevis.6). I graduated from Middletown High School North in 2000 near the top of my class.
