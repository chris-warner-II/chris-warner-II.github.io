Fleas
======

Key Am - 88 BPM]

Intro: {instr.}
{vs1}
        Am     {riff}                 Dm         Em      
I got fleas crawling up my leg         as I drum.
        Am             Dm     Em       Am      
And it makes me play harder, louder, faster. 

{vs2}
I got black dots on my white socks Bouncing to the beat.
As they crawl up past my sock line,
          Dm        Em            Am     {instr.}
(Oh God!) Is that a freckle or a flea?
- - -
{vs3}
Oh they live in the purple carpet
And exist as much as the carpet itself exists.
You can’t go even down to the fridge
Dm              Em      Dm
Without picking up a couple.

[Cho]         C                         G
That shows You can’t be in this world and not of it,
      Am                    Em
The fleas they are too small.
         Am
Oh they crawl in under your bedroom door
  Dm    Em
Or they ride in on the cat... Don’t you like the cat?
{instr. over verse + Harp}

{vs4}
The fleas love Cal’ifornia just like the tourists and venture capitalists
Because it never rains, it never freeze, It never changes.
And thats conducive to pests.
{instr.}

{vs5}
Did you know that Noah in the Ark Never closed the door?
No it was not shut by the hand of man
        Dm     Em     Dm
It was closed by the Lord.

No, you can’t be in the flood and expect not to get wet.
The rain keeps pouring down
Oh you may drown if you try to swim,
But you’ll damn sure drown if you don’t.

{vs. riff over repeat a cpl times}
But all the while, 
And all the more,
And all the still ….
[Dm Em Am]
California needs the rain.
