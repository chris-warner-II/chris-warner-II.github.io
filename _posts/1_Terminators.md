Terminators
======

  Key D  :   (also, capo 7 in G) — note: 5* = C+2
{Science != conscience} ((80 BPM)

{intro.} - [ 4 5 1 4 | 5* 4 1] - w/ harp? 

{vs1}. The [1] time that we turned on the [4] terminators, We were
       The [1] picture of success and [4] wealths.
       And [5] now that they’re printing [4] replacement parts, 
       They’ve [5*] purchased them [4] selves off the [1] shelfs. 

{vs2}. The alliance of science considered for years 
       If it was feasible & conceivable that we could
       But never somuchas 1 second considered whetherornot we should.

{br1}. And [6] since they’ve designed themselves [5] Wheels
       And treads and [4] rotors and [5] engines, The [1] drones
       Have [4] erected an [5] empire in [1] printed ram-[4]-parts
       [5] From atop of their [4] printed [1] thrones.

{Harp} - D-harp over verse chords 1x.

{vs3}. Until the 3D printer that printed more printers 
       Had printed itself an heir.
       While down here in the city of New Babylon, 
       We live in our quiet despaaiir [emph bass G].

{br2}. Because we’re no longer are calling the shots; we must trust
       That they’re calling them well.
       But if you allow your brow a shadow of doubt, 
       Their sensors can certainly tell.

	{{ 2 false starts. }}

{vs4}. So now we live and we die while in single file lines,
       And doze in our easy chairs.
       We close our blinds to the fires in the sky …
       Pretending they just aren’t there.

{{ Outro }}

[4 5 1]   Or we convince ourselves that we don’t care.
[4 5 1 4] ButThat don’t deter theDeathSquads approaching onTheHorizon.
[5* 4 1]   {{& We’re staring square in their sites with our guise on.}}

      {New finger pick pattern} - (maybe slower too)
{end} [4 5 1]  While they’ve enacted a new campaign
      [4 5 1]    In the interest of society.
      [4 5 1 4]  Thats To Poll the Populous To Cull the Outliers.
      [4 5 1]    It makes perfect sense / consider it statistically.
      [       ]
      [4 5 1 4]  And they’ve started a new campaign 
      [4 5 1  ]  To promote peace and unity.
      [4 5 1 4]  The plan is ToPoll the populous To cull the outliers.
      [4 5 1]    Its already being done implicitly.
      [4 5 1]    And largely/supercedingly suspiciouslessly 
      [4 5 1 4]  See, its implementable algorithmic’-(a)lly            
      [4 5 1]    From what you post to social media feeds.
