Strangeness
======

[C] What is this?
[F] Its a strange-ness
That [G] encompasses [F] everything [C] I see. [G C]
[C] Opened the gates
[F] To an Altered State
[G] Now Im out here [F] swimming in this [C] sea.
Just [Am] me, these stars, these [F]trees, and this [C] LSD. [G]

{Bridge 1} - [Am G F C]

Where [Am] tree bark crawls like [G] fi’re  embers
And [F] waves like sheaves of [C] wheat
I hear [Am] avian co’nversa’ [G] tions 
And [F] insectile symphonies [C]

{Chorus 1} - [Am F G C]

Time’s dilating something fierce tonight. 
Time’s dilating fears tonight.
Eyes’ dilating something fierce tonight. 
Eyes’ dilating fierce . .  tonight. 
(hang on G on last one into instrumental)


{Verse 2} - [C (Am) F | G F C]
And the sun’s late day rays
Burn upon the hill side’s face
And the moon’s rising full and fat in the sky.
As she [Am] takes my hand
In this [F]star crossed land
I can [G] see it in her face she [F] loves me, so why don’t [C] I?

{Bridge 2} - [Am G F C]
Stars flicker just like fire embers
Wind blows through stands of trees
Above alien fascinations
And celestial (mysteries/majesties)

{Chorus 2} - [Am F G C]
Time’s Dilating something fierce…
(Strings Vibrating) (in my ears / something fierce)
