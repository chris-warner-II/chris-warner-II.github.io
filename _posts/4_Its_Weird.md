It's Weird
======

Chorus 1:
Its [D] weird not to be [A] weird.
Its [Bm] strange to never be a [E] stranger.
An [G] untenable absurdity to never wrestle with /
  entertain [A] uncertainty at [D] any time [A] [D].
       
Verse 1:      
  When Logic    | Its black or white
  verses intuition  | Wrong or right
  Pits Science    | You'd better join the fight
  Against religion  | Take up your position       

Chorus 2:
Its [D] weird not to be [A] weird.
Its [Bm] strange to never be a [E] stranger.
An [G] untenable absurdity to never wrestle with /
  entertain [A] uncertainty
   An [G] absolute catastrophe to never get to paint
   your [A] masterpiece with this [D] life [A] [D].
        
Verse 2:
  Red or blue   |   When All you care to be’s
  You’d better choose | Your group identity
  There’s nothing new | You know, you’ll never see 
  To belong to    | Because you never listen

Chorus 3:
Its [D] weird not to be [A] weird.
Its [Bm] strange to never be a [E] stranger.
An [G] untenable absurdity to never wrestle with /
  entertain [A] uncertainty
   An [G] absolute catastrophe to never get to paint
   your [A] masterpiece
   Its something of a [G] sacrilege to be so (mother-) fuckin’  
  [A] vacuous just to fall in [D] line [A] [D]
                
Outro:
Just to fall in [G] line, just to fall in [A] line.
Just to feel [G] fine, just to feel [A] fine.
So just fall in line. [D A D]
