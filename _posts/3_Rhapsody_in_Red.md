Rhapsody in Red
======

Intro: [ A - - D A (A2 A)] x2 
(D is a stutter step - almost a messup - a late transition) 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
{Verse 1}
She’s a [A] storm in a [A] teacup, <- (intro chords)
A [D] Rhapsody in [A] red.         <- (intro chords)
A [D] Tornado of twisted [E] sheets On top of my [A] bed. [A4]
She’s a [A] seizure wave that [D] propagates [F#m] through my [D] head
Leaving [A]rubble and ruin in the [D] wake of its [A] spread.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
{Chorus}
But its [D] alright; She’ll last the [A] night
She’ll be [E] gone come the dawns gray [A] light
But I don’t [D] fight; In fact, I pay it no [A] mind [A4]
Most of the [E] time.  {Most of the [E7] time.}

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
{ instr + A harp solo } 
{ intro x2 } + { D A D E7  }
{ A - D A }  + { + hold A }

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
{bridge}
 
I wake up and she’s gone (A- - A4 A]
Sweeps away with the fog (F#m - E  F#m]
Meanwhile my [D] greatest enemy is seated [E] right between [A] my ears.  

Either [D] Assailed by fears or [A] aspirations, 
My [E] mind will not hang [A]loose
And in the [D]winding of its wheels wraps [E] itself into a [A] noose 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
{Verse 2} 
So that now, She’s a [D] storm in a [A] teacup, she’s a [D] Rhapsody in [E7] red.
And I’m a [A] tangled up thatch of [D] weeds sprouting up out of my [A] head.
She’s a [A] hurricane came to [D] inundate the [F#m] water [D] shed
And Im a [A] white pelican standing on the beach staring [D] out [A] dumbfounded.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Chorus again.

{A Straight Harp} [A D A E]
