title: "2. Binary latent variable model infers hidden causal structure from observations"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/CA_model.png' width='350' height='300'/> <img src='/images/CA_Robustness.png' width='550' height='400'/><br/> The 'Noisy-OR model' was successfully used to infer hidden diseases from observed symptoms by assuming a probabilistic causal relationship between the two. We adapt the framework to neuron spiking mechanics and predict latent 'cell assembly' activations from the observed spiking activity of a population of neurons in the retina. We construct a latent variable model where observations and latent states are both binary and fit it using expectation maximization. We validate model performance on synthetic data and finally discuss found structure in the model fit to real retina responses to natural movies."
