title: "2. Binary latent variable model infers hidden causal structure from observations"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/CA_model.png' width='350' height='300'/> <img src='/images/CA_Robustness.png' width='550' height='400'/><br/> We introduce a novel, probabilistic binary latent variable model to detect noisy or approximate repeats of patterns in sparse binary data. The 'Noisy-OR model' was previously used to infer hidden diseases from observed symptoms by assuming a probabilistic causal relationship between the two. We adapt the framework to neuron spiking mechanics and demonstrate the model's capability by extracting structure in recordings from retinal neurons, where the task is to 'explain' spikes of individual neurons in terms of groups of neurons, 'Cell Assemblies' (CAs), that often fire together, due to mutual interactions or other causes. The conditional probability kernels of the latent components are learned from the data in an expectation maximization scheme, involving inference of latent states and parameter adjustments to the model. We thoroughly validate the model on synthesized spike trains constructed to statistically resemble recorded retinal responses to white noise stimulus and natural movie stimulus in data. We also apply our model to spiking responses recorded in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) during stimulation with a movie and discuss the found structure."
