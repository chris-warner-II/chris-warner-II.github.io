title: "3. Protein-Drug Interaction Prediction using Machine Learning"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/CODA_Airflow_Dags_flowchart.pdf' width='550' height='400'><img src='/images/CODA_ec50_ligand_and_ach2.png' width='550' height='400'><br/> As a Machine Learning consultant for CODA Biotherapeutics, I contributed to an algorithm that guides development of a chemogenetic platform designed to modulate neuronal activity to therapeutic effect. The model predicts the fitness of novel synthetic ligand-gated ion channels that were engineered to be highly responsive to a specific small molecules but are otherwise inactive. Models were trained on proteins that had been synthesized and measured in the lab, a slow and expensive process. We used machine learning prediction on novel protein-ligand combinations to decrease the time and cost of this discovery process. We developed and deployed the pipeline to (1). embed protein and ligand information as inputs, (2). encode laboratory measurements as outputs, (3). train models including hyperparameter tuning, and (4). simulate novel receptors - making predictions on them and evaluating fitness of those based on model predictions."

CODA Biotherapeutics develops a chemogenetic platform designed to modulate neuronal activity. With chemogenetics, target neuronal populations are modified using gene therapy to express a tunable ligand-gated ion channel. These ligand-gated ion channels are engineered to be highly responsive to a specific proprietary small molecule but are otherwise inactive. The interaction of the small molecule and engineered receptor allows for exquisite, dose-dependent control of the neurons to generate the therapeutic effect.
