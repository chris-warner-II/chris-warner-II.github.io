CODA Biotherapeutics develops a chemogenetic platform designed to modulate neuronal activity. With chemogenetics, target neuronal populations are modified using gene therapy to express a tunable ligand-gated ion channel. These ligand-gated ion channels are engineered to be highly responsive to a specific proprietary small molecule but are otherwiseinactive. The interaction of the small molecule and engineered receptor allows for exquisite, dose-dependent control of the neurons to generate the therapeutic effect.
