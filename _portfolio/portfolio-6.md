Though I have been steeped in deep / machine learning due to pursuing my Ph.D. in computational neuroscience during its rise (2011-2019), my specific projects focused on other topics within neuroscience and data modelling. While I am quite comfortable with neural networks on a conceptual and academic level, I have not coded up many neural network algorithms ... until now! This [repo](https://github.com/chris-warner-II/pytorch_projects) contains a *growing* number of projects implemented in PyTorch and showcased in Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate my ability to develop machine learning algorithms. 

These projects include:
======

1. [`01_Linear_Regression.ipynb`](https://github.com/chris-warner-II/pytorch_projects/blob/main/01_Linear_Regression.ipynb) - description here
2. [`02_Binary_Classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/chris-warner-II/pytorch_projects/blob/main/02_Binary_Classification.ipynb) - description here
3. [`03_Multi_Classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/chris-warner-II/pytorch_projects/blob/main/03_Multi_Classification.ipynb) - description here
