title: "1. Coupled oscillator model for image segmentation"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/img_seg_model.png' width='500' height='400'/> <img src='/images/cartoonization.png' width='300' height='200'/> <br/> Inspired by neuroscience and the retina, we built a model that performs image segmentation by grouping together nearby image regions with similar features in phase space. The model simulates phase relaxation in a system of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with the strength of interaction defined by the Topographic Modularity between regions in the image. This method outperforms other methods of network construction and spectral Eigen-based methods for community detection. We demonstrate its performance on the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset (BSDS), compare to other methods and discuss the intuition and implications of such a computation in the retina."
