***Verse 1:*** \
  As cold as science; As hot as hate; \
  As far as love is from masturbate. \
  Seems only small men can become great. \
  For they’ve nothing else to lend them weight, \
  And they've so much missing for which to compensate. 

***Chorus 1:*** \
  So these days, \
  Even small men caste long shadow when the sun is sinking low. \
  Even small men caste long shadow when the sun is sinking low, \
  When the leaves will bury each year. 

***Verse 2:*** \
  As empty as politics; \
  As meaningless; As ludicrous. \
  We are led here by the least of us. \
  And your culture is not your friend. \
  Turns out that Rome is teetering again.

***Chorus 2:*** \
  Cause these days, \
  Even small men caste long shadow when the sun is sinking low. \
  Even small men caste long shadow when the sun is sinking low, \
  When the leaves will bury each year.

  And the moon will make things more clear. \
  That there's nothing but fear and nothing besides, \
  Deep down here in the holes of their eyes.

  And in a season of personal attacks and super-pacs, \
  Seems that I’m singing while the ship goes down.
