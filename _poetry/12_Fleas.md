excerpt: "I got fleas crawling up my leg..."
---

***Verse 1:*** \
  I got fleas crawling up my leg \
  As I drum. \
  And it makes me play \
  Harder, louder, faster.

***Verse 2:*** \
  I got black dots on my white socks \
  Bouncing to the beat. \
  As they crawl up past my sock line, \
  (Oh God!) Is that a freckle or a flea?

***Verse 3:*** \
  You see, they live in the purple carpet \
  And exist as much as the carpet itself exists. \
  You can’t go down to the fridge \
  Without picking up a couple.

***Chorus 1:*** \
  And that proves \
  You can’t be in this world and not be of it, \
  Cause the fleas they are too small. \
  Oh they'll crawl in under your bedroom door \
  Or they'll ride in on the cat... \
  Don’t you like the cat?

***Verse 4:*** \
  See, all these fleas love California \
  Just like the tourists and the venture capitalists \
  Because it never rains, it never freeze, It never changes. \
  And thats conducive to pests.

***Verse 5:*** \
  Well did you know that Noah, in the Ark, \
  Never closed the door? \
  No it was not shut by the hand of any man \
  But was closed by the Lord.

***Chorus 2:*** \
  That's because, \
  You can’t be in the flood and expect not to get wet. \
  As the rain keeps pouring down \
  Sure you may drown if you try to swim, \
  But you’ll damn sure drown if you don’t.

***Outro:*** \
  But all the while, \
  And all the more, \
  And all in all, \
  California needs the rain.
