***Intro:*** \
  Gathered together; \
  Hidden from view. \
  Imperceptibly tethered, \
  Me and you. \
  Isolation in Union.

***Verse:*** \
  And its only, \
  Only cause were lonely, \
  The boney king of nowhere \
  Speaks from beneath the stairs. \
  He’s stoney-faced.  \
  Surrounded by his cronies. They \
  Are pointing phony fingers \
  Up at the witness chair.

  Meanwhile, we’re \
  Exchanging glares and glances, \
  Broken and misused chances, \
  Strange and solo dances \
  Led from within each hull. \
  Intertwined and interfacing, \ 
  But, Individual.

***Pre-Chorus:*** \
  In-di-vid-u-al.  In-Div-idu-al-i- ty. \
  That viscousness existant between you and me. \
  A heart as Cold as Ice.  Viscous like a vice. \
  Enmeshed in flesh til something fresh will set us free.

***Chorus 1:***
  But baby it's all right, Baby it's all wrong. \
  It's alright, don’t go singing that same sad song. \
  It might last the night, but won’t last too long. \
  Baby grit your bite; muster up your might. \
  You got to hold on.

***Bridge:*** \
  I've got a staggering amount \
  Of fear and doubt \
  Threatening to bury me. \
  Dug down so deep I can’t get out \
  Disdain enough for two or three.

  Assayed to be the source of a new solution. \
  Come ride into the ranks of the revolution. \
  Climb up through the cracks of your own pollution. \
  Or dive down to the depths of your destitution.

***Chorus 2:*** \
  Baby, it's all right when it goes all wrong. \
  It's alright, I'm not just singing another sad song. \
  Troubles may last the night, but damn if dont make you strong. \
  Lace your boots up tight; start pushing for the light. \
  Yeah it's time to move on.

***Outro:*** \
  Enmeshed in flesh until something fresh will set us free. \
  Temporarily, but not eternally. \
  In Isolation In Union.
