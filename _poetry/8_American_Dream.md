***Verse 1:*** \
  These leaders agree that we’re living at ease, \
  But I can see they’re squeezin' blood from a stone. \
  Free market ferris wheel of war and peace, \
  But I want off, I can’t take it any more.

***Verse 2:*** \
  We’re building bigger houses; Clouds is touching down. \
  Think they’re gonna keep us safe and warm. \
  Feel the slashing rain; Hear that freight train sound. \
  These castles made of sand can’t withstand this storm.

***Chorus 1:*** \
  But, this is your American Dream; \
  This is your American Dream. \
  Exporting exploitation for dirty digits on your screen; \
  Packed in shit brick shanty shack's shellacked in plasticine. \
  Yea, this is your American Dream.

***Verse 3:*** \
  So, let’s all go to war! \
  Consumption Junction, whats your function. \
  Souls are sold while lives are spent, \
  While manufactured consumption manufactures consent. \

***Chorus 2:*** \
  But, this is your American Dream. \
  Yea, this is your American Dream. \
  Exporting exploitation for fucking sacs of gold and green; \
  Raping mother nature from her lap of luxury; \
  Your golden years brought to you by world wide wage slavery. \
  Yea, this is your American Dream. \
  Tell me this ain’t your American Dream. \
  Well wait, but ain’t this your American Dream?
