excerpt: "Step aside and recompile every once or twice a while..."

***Verse 1:*** \
  Step aside and recompile every once or twice a while. \
  Let the fans cool your engines down. \
  There's a reason you grow wily by the time you’re thirty-five; \
  To support your aging frame requires guile. \
  So step aside and recompile once every while.

***Verse 2:*** \
  Stop and restock every three or four blocks, \
  Or hurdles to climb up to life’s finish line. \
  I’ll tell you a secret; Consider the thought: \
  There’s no finish line, but only a clock. \
  So take a breath and take five and take stock.
