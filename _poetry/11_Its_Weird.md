excerpt: "It's weird not to be weird..."

***Chorus 1:*** \
  It's weird not to be weird. \
  And it's strange to never be a stranger. \
  An untenable absurdity \
  To never wrestle with uncertainty \
  At any time.
       
***Verse 1:*** \
  When logic verses intuition \
  Pits science against religion, \
  It's either black or white; It's either wrong or right. \
  You'd better join the fight. Take up your position.

***Chorus 2:*** \
  But I'm saying \
  It's weird not to be weird. \
  And it's strange to never be a stranger. \
  An untenable absurdity \
  To never wrestle with uncertainty; \
  Yea, an absolute catastrophe \
  To never get to paint your masterpiece \
  With this life.
        
***Verse 2:*** \
  It's red or blue, You’d better choose. \
  There’s nothing new to belong to. \
  When All you care to be’s your group identity, \
  Know you can never see because you'll never listen.

***Chorus 3:*** \
  But don't you think that \
  It's weird not to be weird? \
  Ain't it strange to never be a stranger? \
  An untenable absurdity \
  To never wrestle with uncertainty; \
  Yea, an absolute catastrophe \
  To never get to paint your masterpiece; \
  See, it's something of a sacrilege \
  To be so motherfuckin’ vacuous \
  just to fall in line.
                
***Outro:*** \
  Just to fall in line, just to fall in line. \
  Just to feel fine, just to feel fine. \
  So just fall in line.
