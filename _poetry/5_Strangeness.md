Strangeness
======

***Verse 1:*** \
  What is this? Its a strangeness \
  That encompasses everything I see. \
  Opened the gates to an Altered State, \
  Now I'm out here just swimming in this sea. \
  Just me, these stars, these trees, this LSD. \

***Bridge 1:*** \
  Where tree bark crawls like fire embers, \
  And waves like sheaves of wheat. \
  I hear avian conversations, \
  And insectile symphonies. \

***Chorus 1:*** \
  And time’s dilating something fierce tonight. \
  Time’s dilating fears tonight. \
  Eyes’ dilating something fierce tonight. \
  Eyes’ dilating fierce . . . tonight. \

***Verse 2:*** \
  And the sun’s late day rays burn upon the hill side’s face. \
  And the moon’s rising full and fat in the sky. \
  As she takes my hand In this star crossed land, \
  I can see it in her face she loves me, so why don’t I? \

***Bridge 2:*** \
  Stars flicker just like fire embers, \
  Wind blows through stands of trees. \
  Above alien fascinations, \
  And celestial mysteries. \

***Chorus 2:*** \
  And time’s dilating something fierce tonight. \
  Time’s dilating fears tonight. \
  Strings vibrating in my ears tonight. \
  Strings vibrating fierce . . . tonight.
