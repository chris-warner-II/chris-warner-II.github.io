Rhapsody in Red
======

Verse 1:
  She’s a storm in a teacup, A Rhapsody in red.
  A tornado of twisted sheets On top of my bed.
  She’s a seizure wave that propagates through my head
  Leaving rubble and ruin in the wake of its spread.

Chorus:
  But its alright; She’ll only last the night
  She’ll be gone come the dawns gray light
  But I don’t fight; In fact, I pay it no mind
  Most of the time. Most of the time.

Bridge: 
  I wake up and she’s gone. Sweeps away with the fog. 
  While my greatest enemy remains right between my ears.  
  Either assailed by fears or aspirations, 
  My mind will not hang loose
  And in the winding of its wheels 
  Wraps itself into a noose 

Verse 2:
  So that now, She’s a storm in a teacup, 
  She’s a Rhapsody in red.
  And I’m a tangled up thatch of weeds sprouting up out of my head.
  She’s a hurricane came to inundate the water shed
  And I'm a white pelican standing on the beach staring out dumbfounded.

Chorus:
  But its alright; She’ll only last the night
  She’ll be gone come the dawns gray light
  But I don’t fight; In fact, I pay it no mind
  Most of the time. Most of the time.
