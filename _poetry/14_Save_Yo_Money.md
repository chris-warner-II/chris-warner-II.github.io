***Verse 1:*** \
  Don't slip, don’t trip, \
  Don't lose your grip, \
  Your paper mache safety net gonna rip. \
  Babaaay. Babaay.

  The way she shakes her hips, \
  The way she moves her lips, \
  You’re hangin your heart on a crucifix. \
  Babaaay. Babaay.

***Chorus:***
  So mama said better save yo money. \
  Papa said keep your day job. \
  Save it up for a rainy day. \
  Stack it up in your 401k. \
  I tell you son, you better listen to me, \
  Or you'll living that dream like a fool's scheme \
  These days. Babaay.

***Verse 2:*** \
  So dont investigate, contest \
  Or even question how, \
  Just keep your nose to the grindstone \
  And your hand to the plow. \
  Babaaay. Babaay.

  You better get in where you fit in. \
  Dont you be too proud, \
  Cause the nail that stands out \
  Just gonna get hammered down. \
  Babaaay. Babaay.

***Bridge:*** \
  Say hey man, tell me what’s your plan. \
  I'm gonna ride on out to the promise land. \
  I'm gonna make my stand, I'm gonna play my hand, \
  I'm gonna play guitar in a rock and roll band. \
  Babaaay. Babaay.


***Verse 3*** \
  I never knew what I was doin more than faith allowed. \
  I always knew I would make it through somehow. \
  Babaaay. Babaay.

  They say to, Make hay while the suns still shining, \
  I say, Get busy living or get busy dying. \
  You can fail at something you ain't even trying. \
  You can Do no wrong, but still do no right. \
  Babaaay. Babaay. \
  Babaaay. Believe Me!
