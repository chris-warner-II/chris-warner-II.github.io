excerpt: "The time that we turned on the Terminators..."

***Verse 1:*** \
  The time that we turned on the terminators, \
  We were the picture of success and wealths. \
  But now that they’re printing replacement parts, \
  They’ve purchased themselves off the shelfs.

***Verse 2:*** \
  The alliance of science considered for years \
  If it was feasible and conceivable that we could. \
  But never so much as one second considered \
  Whether or not we should.

***Bridge 1:*** \
  And now since they’ve designed themselves \
  Wheels and treads and rotors and engines, The drones \
  Have erected an empire in printed ramparts \
  From atop of their printed thrones.

***Verse 3:*** \
  Then one day, the 3D printer that printed more printers \
  Had printed itself an heir. \
  While down here in the city of New Babylon, \
  We live in our quiet despair.

***Bridge 2:*** \
  Because we’re no longer are calling the shots, we must trust \
  That they’re calling them well. \
  But if you allow your brow a shadow of doubt, \
  Their sensors can certainly tell.

***Verse 4:*** \
  So now we live and we die while in single file lines, \
  And we doze in our easy chairs. \
  And we close our blinds to the fires in the sky, \
  Pretending they just aren’t there.

***Outro:*** \
  Or worse, we convince ourselves that we don’t care. \
  But that don’t deter the Death Squads approaching on the horizon. \
  Staring square in their sites with our guise on.

  While they’ve enacted a new campaign \
  In the interest of society. \
  And the plan is to poll the populous \
  To cull the outliers. \
  It makes perfect sense statistically.

  Say, they’ve started a new campaign \
  To promote peace and unity. \
  And the plan is to poll the populous \
  To cull the outliers. \
  It's already being done implicitly. \
  And supercedingly suspiciouslessly. \
  See, its implementable algorithmically \
  From what you post to social media feeds.
