excerpt: "Mother, I’ve had to exorcise you from me,..."

***Verse 1:*** \
  Mother, I’ve had to exorcise you from me, \
  All of your concerns and anxieties. \
  All of your spurns and your cigarette burns. \
  These battles of wills from my toddlery. \
  These lessons I’ve learned I lay down at your feet. \
  You see they never were mine; I return them to thee.

***Chorus 1:*** \
  The youngest among us are the poorest it seems; \
  Soak it up like sponges, just born to believe \
  What you tell them bout themselves, bout yourself, bout me. \
  A tabula rasa on the greenest of screens. \
  Porous as a forest or a great coral reef.

***Verse 2:*** \
  Father, I've had to jettison you from my house. \
  These lessons once learned are easily turned, now I'm kickin you out. \
  Along with these mounds of malignant self-doubt. \
  The gods of our fathers can be false.

***Chorus 2:*** \
  The youngest among us are the poorest it seems. \
  Soak it up like sponges, just born to believe \
  What you tell them bout themselves, bout yourself, bout me. \
  A tabula rasa on the greenest of screens. \
  Plugged in long before they know what that means, \
  Porous as a forest or a great coral reef.
