excerpt: "What is this emotion got him loping around, ..."

***Verse 1:*** \
  What is this emotion got him loping around, \
  With his feet up in the sky and his head under ground? \
  Weighted by a worried mind, these years and these pounds, \
  Facing down the breakers, see him swimmin out! 

***Chorus:*** \
  Cause he's an Otter in the Ocean, \
  He's an Otter in the Ocean. \
  He's an Otter in the Ocean of your love.

  Cause he's an Otter in the Ocean, \
  He's an Otter in the Ocean. \
  He's an Otter in the Ocean full of \
  Bigger fish to fry.

***Verse 2:*** \
  See he's an otter in the ocean, think he's drinkin' to drown. \
  Blinkin' at the notion he ain't wearin' no frown. \
  Just wants a chair in the commotion, simple seat in the sound. \
  He's chokin' on that potion, reelin', feelin' like he's Hell bound!

***Verse 3:*** \
  This world wonâ€™t quit its spinning, shit is stressing me out. \
  These dogs descending, never-ending dressing me down. \
  These voices in my head these days are gettin too loud and \
  In spite of all my rage, I'm just a 'nother face in the crowd.
