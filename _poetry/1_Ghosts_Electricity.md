excerpt: "These Ghosts’ electricity \
  Mingle inside of your head. \
  Some call it Maximum Entropy, \
  These electrons conspire instead."

***Verse 1:*** \
  These Ghosts’ electricity \
  Mingle inside of your head. \
  Some call it Maximum Entropy, \
  These electrons conspire instead.

***Pre-chorus 1:*** \
  And thus these modern Angels and Demons \
  Take breath. \
  Break bread. \
  Persist.

***Chorus 1:*** \
  No, they don’t rest just because you are \
  a rational determinist. \
  And, there are things just beneath the surface \
  That are steering your ship.

***Bridge:*** \
  They say what goes up must come down; \
  I say that what’s within can’t help come out. \
  Like the tallest tree grows from the smallest sprout, \
  With its roots dug in the ground.

  And it damn sure makes a sound \
  When it comes crashing down. \
  Even if you don’t think you’ll be around, \
  That shit compounds.

***Verse 2:*** \
  Just like \
  These Ghosts’ electricity \
  That mingle inside of your head. \
  Some call it Maximum Entropy, \
  But these electrons conspire instead.

***Pre-chorus 2:*** \
  And thus these modern Angels and Demons \
  Take breath. \
  Break bread. \
  Persist. \
  Shape-shift.

***Chorus 2:*** \
  See, there are things thrust beneath the surface \
  That are steering the ship. \
  And, they don’t rest just because you are \
  a rational determinist. \
