excerpt: "Little filthy drifter floatin' down the street,..."

***Verse 1:*** \
  Little filthy drifter floatin' down the street, \
  Wavin' hello to every eye he meet. \
  No one sayin' nothing; They just shuffle their feet, \
  And keep on passing him by.

  But everybody knows he’s got a dangerous plan, \
  Never breathe a word about a helping hand. \
  If he had legs he would probably stand, \
  And lope on down to the bay.

***Chorus:*** \
  But the Pacific patch is in the distance floatin', \
  And it stretches on for miles and miles. \
  Some claim that a rising tide will raise all the ships in the ocean, \
  As The Refuse accretes into gyres.

***Bridge:*** \
  But if its beyond what my-y-y-y eye can see, \
  Then it don’t concern me. \
  And as long as my-y-y-y front porch clean, \
  Then it ain’t effectin' me. \
  As long as it don’t infect my seed, \
  Then it never occurred to me.

***Verse 2:*** \
  So, I see \
  A little filthy drifter floatin' down the street, \
  Wavin' hello to every eye he meet. \
  No one sayin' nothing; They just shuffle their feet, \
  And keep on passing him by.

***End:***
  While we communally, collectively, \
  Continually choose t’ignore all the least of these.

  And our world just slips away \
  Day by day.
