excerpt: "In this paper, we apply a 'Noisy-Or' binary latent variable model, previously used to infer underlying diseases from observed symptoms, to the domain of neuroscience. We model the observed spiking responses of a population of Retinal Ganglion cells as a combination of individual neuron Poisson activity and activations of latent, unobserved 'cell assemblies' which lead to the synchronous firing of multiple cells with probabilistic membership. This model more accurately reflects the non-Poisson firing behavior of Retinal Ganglion cell population responding to natural movie stimulus."

We use a Noisy-Or model, previously applied to disease modelling, to learn latent structure in observed spiking patterns from a population of rat retinal ganglion cells in response to white noise and natural movie stimulus. The probabalistic generative model, fit with the expectation maximization algorithm, captures approximately repeated groups of neurons often coactive together without requiring exact repeats. These cell assemblies capture the fine-temporal correlations in population spike trains that differ across stimulus conditions but are not necessarily stimulus locked. We discuss the spatial structure of cells in cell assemblies and what features of the stimulus is represented by a cell assembly above and beyond the union of the representations of its member cells.
