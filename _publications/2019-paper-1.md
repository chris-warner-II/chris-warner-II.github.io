title: "Cell Assembly Model for Retinal Ganglion Cell population"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-paper-1
excerpt: "In this paper, we apply a 'Noisy-Or' binary latent variable model, previously used to match observed symptoms to underlying diseases, to the domain of neuroscience. We model the observed spiking responses of a population of Retinal Ganglion cells as a combination of individual neuron Poisson activity and the activations of latent, unobserved 'cell assemblies' which lead to the synchronous activity of multiple cells with probabilistic membership. This model more accurately reflects the non-Poisson firing behavior of Retinal Ganglion cell population responding to natural movie stimulus."
